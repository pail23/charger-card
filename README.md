### HACS

This card is not yet available as default in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store), but can still be installed through HACS by adding this repository as a custom repository inside HACS settings.

### Manual

1. Download `keba-charger-card.js` file from the [latest-release].
2. Put `keba-charger-card.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `keba-charger-card.js` in Lovelace. There are two ways to do that:
   1. **Using UI:** _Configuration_ ‚Üí _Lovelace Dashboards_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí Click Plus button ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/keba-charger-card.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
   2. **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
      ```yaml
      resources:
        - url: /local/keba-charger-card.js
          type: module
      ```
4. Add `custom:keba-charger-card` to Lovelace UI as any other card (using either editor or YAML configuration).

## Using the card

This card can be configured using Lovelace UI editor.

1. In Lovelace UI, click 3 dots in top left corner.
2. Click _Configure UI_.
3. Click Plus button to add a new card.
4. Find _Custom: Charger Card_ in the list.
5. Choose `entity` and select the main status sensor of your charger.
6. Now you should see the preview of the card!
7. Do your customizations in UI editor or manually in code editor.

_Sorry, there is no support for `actions` and `stats` in visual UI editor yet._

Typical example of using this card in YAML config would look like this:

```yaml
type: 'custom:keba-charger-card'
entity: binary_sensor.keba_p30_status
```

## Features

- Animations: If choosing the default images of Easee chargers in any color, you can also choose to show leds which will behave according to charger status. This is identical to how the charger looks physically and similar to the Easee app and web site. Two leds for standby, all leds when connected, flashing while charging and so on. If SmartCharging is enabled, leds will be blue.
- Collapsible menu buttons: Click on one of the menu buttons (if you enabled them) to get more info, config or limit settings.
- Possibility to set current limits from UI
- Stats items (data table) will depend on charger status and show most relevant information unless you choose to customize it
- Action items on toolbar will depend on charger status and show most relevant actions. Custom actions are added in addition to defaults.

## Supported models

This card currently supports charging robots from <a href='https://easee-international.com/'>Easee</a>. It could be modified to support basically any charger, but adoptions of the code will be necessary since there is no platform in Home Assistant for chargers making the interface identical.

Supported chargers:

- Easee
